# **docker**: venv on steroids

Commands to simply manage [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) containers for the current project: [create](cmd-docker-create) and [destroy](cmd-docker-destroy), run [shell](cmd-docker-shell) and [commands](cmd-docker-run) inside, [make it cool](cmd-docker-prepare). Motivation isn't wrap around whole Docker, but make it easier for newbies to work with simple containers and integrate it with DepHell. It's achieved by providing all commands from [dephell venv](index-venv) group and a little bit more.
