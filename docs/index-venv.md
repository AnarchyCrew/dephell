# **venv**: virtual environments

Commands to manage virtual environments for the project: [create](cmd-venv-create), and [destroy](cmd-venv-destroy), [activate](cmd-venv-shell), [run commands inside](cmd-venv-run). Most important thing here is you can have as much separated environments for one project as you want. DepHell make it really cheap.

```eval_rst
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    cmd-venv-create
    cmd-venv-destroy
    cmd-venv-run
    cmd-venv-shell
```
